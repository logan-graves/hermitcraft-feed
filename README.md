# hermitcraft-feed
Uses Invidious APIS to build a feed of all hermitcraft episodes.

## Background
Hermitcraft is a popular Minecraft video series. Multiple Minecraft video creators, some with subscriber numbers in the millions, play together, and each creator posts their own perspective, mostly on a weekly-biweekly basis. It's great in many ways, but the problem with this system is that it's difficult and/or tedious to sort through and find what you want. Oh, and YouTube invades your privacy. 

## Function
This site provides multiple different ways to sort the Hermitcraft series, using [APIs](https://docs.invidious.io/API.md) from the [invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/Invidious) project. Invidious is an alternate front-end for YouTube, focused on privacy. 

Thus, this site provides a more-private and more elegant way to view Hermitcraft episodes.

## Learning Purpose
This is my first project actually using git, so it is practice in using a local-first Git/VSCodium workflow. (to build [lens](https://github.com/logan-graves/lens/), my first real project, I used [replit.com](https://replit.com) (formerly repl.it) with no version control.)
To build this site, I also had to learn basic API/JSON usage. 
It is also some practice in web design.
